### Hello, my name is Yaz.  I'm a teacher lived in various of countries. I like to travel around the world as I can. I'm a father of Dave.I know that software engineers, developers creating new technologies making people's life easier . All applications, software made by a lot of efforts by developers. Software is everywhere for example in daily life computer, TV remote control, fridge, printer, scanner, AC, microwave etc. Software development is vary of insutries like health, banking, education, military, fashion, construction, agriculture, trade, transportation, entertaintment etc. Software is vast industry field changing the world.  I like learning new information. By information I mean  especially the programming languages. When can't solve  problems hours of hours and you making new application at the end the feeling is awesome. The question is why I decided to change my career? Because there is an opportunity create new applications that people would benefit and  be professional software engineer or Full Stack Developer. Meet mastermind of best technologies, applicationsa and learn from them. Usually thinking what can give back to community as software engineer(developer) in the future. Programming languages are the tools to solve problems and make life easier. I built simple rails projects before but not a professianl way. I have decided take course because I liked the curriculum(flatiron curriculum). Usually when I learnt by myself questions were why and how. I'm happy to join course because learnt a lot of new things and getting perspctive. Happy coding :)
